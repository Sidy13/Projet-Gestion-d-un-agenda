# Projet-Gestion-d-un-agenda

As part of a second engineering year studies, we had to do a C project including stacks and queues.
To run this project you first have to create a cell and a list, then add the cell in the list. And you can search the value of the cell whit one of the two functions made for it. 
You can also display the list.
